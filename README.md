# Credit_card_fraud_detection
I have crearted a project to analyse the credit card transaction as fraud and normal depending on anonymous factors and amount of transactions

Checking for fraudulent transactions using credit cards
Model used == RF

Anonymous data features + transaction amount + binary value of fraud
2 metrics
Gini impurity
Permutation importance
Overall performance observed through calculating the the AUC 
We use the ROC to check the performance
ROC works upon by changing the threshold chars and observes the total AUC

We also do eda of the data 
To check the sampling 
To check the relation between features
